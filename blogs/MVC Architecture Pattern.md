# MVC Architecture Pattern
When designing your project in NodeJs and other backend language, MVC design pattern are advised to follow. But what really is MVC patterns? Do we have to design our codebase according to certain pattern or aren't we allowed to be free and write all of them down in a single code file? 

First innovation of MVC architecture in found in SmallTalk-80 where each class and objects are assigned seperate task to perform. It follows Single Responsible Principle(SRP). The task and labors are assigned to each other.  In SmallTalk-80, the responsiblity for  each component are designed very clearly.

>The view manages the graphical and/or textual output to the portion of the bitmapped display that is allocated to its application. The controller interprets the mouse and keyboard inputs from the user, commanding the model and/or the view to change as appropriate. Finally, the model manages the behavior and data of the application domain, responds to requests for information about its state (usually from the view), and responds to instructions to change state (usually from the controller).

MVC refers to Models, Views and Controllers. Although the abbreviation and concepts is  quite known among the developers, the indepth explanation are scant.
