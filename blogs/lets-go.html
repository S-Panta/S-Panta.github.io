Each Go module is defined by a go.mod file that describes the module’s properties, including its dependencies on other modules and on versions of Go.
go mod tidy ensures that the go.mod file matches the source code in the module. It adds any missing module requirements necessary to build the current module’s packages and dependencies, and it removes requirements on modules that don’t provide any relevant packages. It also adds any missing entries to go.sum and removes unnecessary entries.
