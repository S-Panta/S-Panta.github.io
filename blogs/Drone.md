# Drone concepts

1. Pipeline and steps (All steps are comtainer only in type docker)
2. Current working directory. /drone/src
3. Communication between steps via name
4. How are the services hosted in the url? using name
5. steps running in sync but can be made async.`"detach":True,`
6. Difference between `command` and `commands`.
7. Volumes
   - /drone/src is shared among all steps
   - To share other volume, need to define the path as share volume in pipe level

- Entry Points in container
- For drone 1.4, `4` trailing slahs should be used for escape character like `\n` or `\t` but for higher version , five trailing slash to be used.
